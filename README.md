I have a strong interest in computer algorithms, graphic design, software production, computer systems, computer networks, computer hardware and so on. I can use C++ to realize algorithm topics, use python to make simple batch programs, crawl web pages, analyze data, use kotlin to write software and terminal programs, and use HTML and CSS to write static web pages.

I am a high school sophomore attending [Shanghai Yucai High School](http://www.yucai.edu.sh.cn/). I enrolled in 2023 and will graduate in 2026.

I participate in my school's computer club and take courses related to the Olympiad in Informatics (OI). During my school years, I have participated in several competitions, such as [National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP)](https://www.noi.cn/), [National Primary and Secondary Schools Information Technology Innovation and Practice Competition (NOC)](http://www.noc.net.cn/), and published an algorithmic paper about segment tree, CDQ division, Mo's algorithm, etc.

You can see my award-winning record in the WeChat official account of my school.
